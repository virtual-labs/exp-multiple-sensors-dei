## Introduction

<b>Discipline | <b>Computer Science  
:--|:--|  
<b> Lab | <b> Internet of Things  
<b> Experiment|     <b> To simulate interfacing of multiple sensors (Ultrasonic Sensor, PIR Sensor, DHT Sensor, Soil Moisture Sensor and MQ135 Sensor) with Arduino.

### About the Experiment 

This experiment focuses on simulating the interfacing of various environmental and motion sensors with the Arduino microcontroller.  
It demonstrates how real-world physical parameters such as distance, temperature, humidity, soil moisture, gas concentration, and motion are detected.  
Students learn signal acquisition techniques and sensor data processing using embedded programs.  
The experiment introduces analog and digital sensor communication principles.  
The simulation provides practical insight into real-time data collection for IoT-based monitoring systems.
